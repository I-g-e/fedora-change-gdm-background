# change-gdm-background

This script automates the process of setting a custom image or color as the background of GNOME Display Manager 3 on Fedora 34 and 35. Other Fedora versions may work as well, but havenâ€™t been tested.

## Warning

This tool was made specifically to work with `.gresource` files.

If you are going to set an image file that has spaces in its file name or folders, remember to escape them with backslashes.

## Installation

First, you will need to install Glib development files with `sudo dnf install glib2-devel`.  
Then you can download the script with the following command:  
```
wget github.com/I-g-e/fedora-change-gdm-background/raw/master/change-gdm-background
```  
And set it as an executable with `chmod +x change-gdm-background`.

## Usage

Run the script with root privileges, (e.g. with `sudo`).

Setting a background image: `sudo ./change-gdm-background /path/to/image`  
Setting a solid color: `sudo ./change-gdm-background '#ffffff'`

The color should be given as a hexadecimal string (six or three characters).

If you see the message `login image sucessfully changed`, your GDM background should be changed to the image/color you specified. The changes will take effect after restarting GDM or rebooting your computer.

You can restore your original GDM theme any time with `sudo ./change-gdm-background --restore`.

### Multi-screen support

if you use two or more monitors, you may see a streched image through the displays as if they were one screen. This is the default behavior of GDM3 when dealing with multiple displays.

See [this comment](https://github.com/thiggy01/change-gdm-background/issues/15) for setting up the monitor configuration of GDM.
